# Exa MCP Server

Exa AI is a smart search engine designed to feed your AI fresh, accurate information directly from the web. Think of it as 
giving your AI access to a constantly updated internet, so it stops inventing "facts" from 2022. It uses "neural search" 
to understand what your AI actually wants to find, not just keywords. This helps combat AI hallucination, which, let's be 
honest, is getting a bit old.

## Connecting Exa AI to Jan AI

To make Jan AI smarter, you'll use the Exa Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This isn't as scary as it sounds. The MCP server 
acts as a translator, letting Jan AI ask Exa to search the web and then delivers the results back, neatly packaged.

How it Works (the short version):
- You ask Jan AI something that requires current web info.
- Jan AI, bless its heart, tells the MCP server what it needs.
- The MCP server gets Exa to do the heavy lifting of searching the internet.
- Exa sends the real-time data back to the MCP server.
- The MCP server hands it off to Jan AI, which then gives you a fact-checked, up-to-date answer. No more guessing games.

This setup means Jan AI can tap into the live web, making it a much more reliable source for current events and information. It's 
like giving Jan AI a direct line to reality.
