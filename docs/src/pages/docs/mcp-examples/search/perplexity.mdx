# Using Perplexity MCP with Jan

Perplexity MCP brings real-time web search and specialized reasoning to your AI conversations. Instead of your model pretending it knows what happened yesterday, it can actually find out.

## What You Get

Perplexity MCP offers two flavors of intelligence:

### Official Go Implementation
- **perplexity_ask**: Real-time web search using Sonar Pro
- **perplexity_reason**: Complex reasoning with Sonar Reasoning Pro
- Fast, minimal setup with pre-built binaries

### Python Implementation  
- **ask_perplexity**: Expert programming assistance and technical explanations
- **chat_perplexity**: Maintains ongoing conversations with full history
- **list_chats_perplexity**: Browse your conversation history
- **read_chat_perplexity**: Retrieve complete chat histories
- **search**: General web search with customizable detail levels

Both give your AI the ability to stop guessing and start knowing.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- Jan installed and running
- A Perplexity API key ([get yours here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started))
- For Go version: Homebrew (macOS/Linux) or manual binary installation
- For Python version: Python 3.10+ and uvx package manager
- A model with tool calling capabilities

<Callout type="info">
  **API Key Required**: Unlike some search engines that pretend to be free, Perplexity requires an API key. The good news? Their pricing is actually reasonable for the quality you get.
</Callout>

## Setup

### Step 1: Enable MCP in Jan

Navigate to **Settings** > **MCP Servers** and toggle **Allow All MCP Tool Permission** ON.

### Step 3: Choose Your Installation Method

You have two solid options. Pick your poison:

#### Option A: Go Implementation (Recommended for Speed)

**Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
brew install alcova-ai/tap/perplexity-mcp
```

**Manual Installation:**
Download the appropriate binary from [Perplexity MCP releases](https://github.com/Alcova-AI/perplexity-mcp/releases) and place it in your PATH.

#### Option B: Python Implementation (More Features)

**Install uvx if you haven't already:**
```bash
pip install uvx
```

### Step 4: Configure MCP Server

Click the `+` button in the MCP Servers section and choose your configuration:

#### For Go Implementation:

- **Server Name**: `perplexity-go`
- **Command**: `perplexity-mcp`
- **Arguments**: (leave empty)
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - Key: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
  - Value: `your-api-key-here`

*[Screenshot placeholder: Go implementation MCP configuration]*

#### For Python Implementation:

- **Server Name**: `perplexity-python`
- **Command**: `uvx`
- **Arguments**: `mcp-perplexity`
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - Key: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
  - Value: `your-api-key-here`
  - Key: `PERPLEXITY_MODEL`
  - Value: `sonar-pro` (optional, this is the default)

### Example Queries

**Real-Time News:**
```
What are the latest developments in AI regulation in the EU this week?
```

**Technical Research:**
```
Search for recent best practices in React server components and explain the key differences from client components
```

**Ongoing Research (Python version):**
```
Start a research conversation about quantum computing advancements in 2024. I want to maintain this conversation for follow-up questions.
```

**Code Validation:**
```
Check if using jQuery in 2024 is considered deprecated for modern web development
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Models

For the Go implementation, you can specify different models:

- **Arguments**: `--model sonar-reasoning-pro --reasoning-model sonar-pro`

For the Python implementation, use environment variables:

- **PERPLEXITY_MODEL_ASK**: `sonar-reasoning-pro`
- **PERPLEXITY_MODEL_CHAT**: `sonar-pro`

### Chat History Management (Python Version)

The Python implementation stores chat history locally. Configure the database path:

- **DB_PATH**: `/path/to/your/chats.db`

### Web UI (Python Version)

Enable a web interface for chat management:

- **WEB_UI_ENABLED**: `true`
- **WEB_UI_PORT**: `8050`
- **WEB_UI_HOST**: `127.0.0.1`

## Use Cases That Matter

### Research and Fact-Checking
Perfect for journalists, researchers, and anyone who needs current, verified information. No more "according to my training data from 2023" responses.

### Technical Problem-Solving
Get current best practices, recent framework updates, and solutions to bleeding-edge problems. Stack Overflow wishes it was this fresh.

### Market Research
Track industry trends, competitor analysis, and market developments in real-time. Your AI finally knows what happened after its training cutoff.

### Academic Research
Access current papers, recent findings, and evolving scientific discussions. Like having a research assistant who never sleeps.

### Code Modernization
Check if your dependencies are deprecated, find modern alternatives, and stay current with evolving best practices.

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't connect?**
- Verify your API key is valid and properly formatted
- For Go version: Ensure the binary is in your PATH
- For Python version: Check that uvx and Python 3.10+ are installed
- Restart Jan completely

**API errors?**
- Check your Perplexity API usage limits
- Verify your API key hasn't expired
- Ensure you have sufficient credits

**No search results?**
- Perplexity's search is context-aware - be specific in your queries
- Check that your model actually supports tool calling
- Try rephrasing your question

**Python version issues?**
- Ensure uvx is properly installed: `pip install uvx`
- Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.10+)
- Verify dependencies: `uvx --help`
