# Using Exa Search MCP with Jan

Exa MCP turns your AI into a research powerhouse. Instead of hallucinating facts or working with stale training data, your model gets real-time access to the web through Exa's AI-powered search engine.

## What You Get

Exa MCP provides eight specialized search tools that actually work:

- **web_search_exa**: General web search with content extraction
- **research_paper_search**: Academic papers and research content
- **company_research**: Deep company analysis and intelligence
- **crawling**: Extract content from specific URLs
- **competitor_finder**: Find business competitors
- **linkedin_search**: Search LinkedIn profiles and companies
- **wikipedia_search_exa**: Wikipedia content retrieval
- **github_search**: Repository and code search

Think of it as giving your AI a PhD in Google-fu.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- Jan installed and running
- An Exa API key ([get yours here](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys))
- A model with tool calling capabilities (Claude, GPT-4, or compatible local models)
- Node.js installed on your machine

<Callout type="info">
  **Model Compatibility**: Not all models play nice with tools. Claude models work exceptionally well. For local models, ensure tool calling is enabled in Jan's model parameters.
</Callout>

## Setup

### Step 1: Enable MCP in Jan

Navigate to **Settings** > **MCP Servers** and toggle **Allow All MCP Tool Permission** ON.

*[Screenshot placeholder: MCP settings page with toggle enabled]*

### Step 2: Get Your Exa API Key

1. Go to [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy it somewhere safe

### Step 3: Add Exa MCP Server

Click the `+` button in the MCP Servers section.

*[Screenshot placeholder: MCP server addition dialog]*

Enter the following configuration:

- **Server Name**: `exa`
- **Command**: `npx`
- **Arguments**: `-y exa-mcp-server`
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - Key: `EXA_API_KEY`
  - Value: `your-actual-api-key-here`

*[Screenshot placeholder: Filled MCP server configuration form]*

### Step 4: Verify Connection

Check that the server shows as active in your MCP Servers list.

### Step 5: Configure Your Model

Use a model provider that supports tool calling. For cloud models:

- **Anthropic**: Ensure tool calling is enabled in Model Providers settings
- **OpenAI**: Tool calling should work by default
- **OpenRouter**: Works with tool-capable models like Claude

*[Screenshot placeholder: Model provider settings with tool calling enabled]*

For local models, enable tool calling in **Model Parameters** > **Model Capabilities**.

## Using Exa MCP

Once configured, start a new chat with your tool-enabled model. The available Exa tools will appear in the tools section.

## Advanced Configuration

### Selective Tool Enabling

If you don't want all eight tools (and who needs that much power?), you can enable specific ones:

- **Command**: `npx`
- **Arguments**: `-y exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search_exa,research_paper_search,company_research`

### Remote MCP Option

For the truly lazy, use Exa's hosted MCP server instead of running it locally:

- **Server Name**: `exa-remote`
- **Command**: `npx`
- **Arguments**: `-y mcp-remote https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=your-api-key`

## Use Cases That Actually Matter

### Academic Research
Perfect for literature reviews, finding recent papers, and staying current with research trends. No more sifting through Google Scholar's ancient interface.

### Competitive Intelligence
Research competitors, analyze market positioning, and gather business intelligence without manual browsing.

### Technical Discovery
Find libraries, tools, and solutions on GitHub. Better than hoping Stack Overflow has the answer.

### Content Curation
Extract and analyze content from specific URLs for research or content creation.

### Professional Networking
Search LinkedIn for potential collaborators, industry experts, or business connections.

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't connect?**
- Verify your API key is correct (no extra spaces or quotes)
- Ensure Node.js is installed
- Restart Jan completely

**Model not using tools?**
- Check that tool calling is enabled for your model
- Try a different model (Claude works best)
- Verify the MCP server is active

**Search results seem off?**
- Exa's AI search is context-aware - be specific in your queries
- Use natural language rather than keyword stuffing

**API key errors?**
- Double-check your key at [dashboard.exa.ai](https://dashboard.exa.ai)
- Ensure you haven't hit rate limits
- Try regenerating the key if issues persist

<Callout type="warning">
  **Rate Limits**: Exa has API rate limits. If you're planning to go full researcher mode, check your plan limits to avoid surprises.
</Callout>

## What's Next

Once you've got Exa MCP running, you'll wonder how you ever did research without it. The combination of Jan's privacy-focused approach with Exa's real-time search capabilities creates a research environment that's both powerful and under your control.

No more tab explosions. No more bookmark chaos. Just ask, and get answers backed by current, relevant sources.
