# Assistants

Jan allows you to manage multiple Assistants, each with its own configuration profile that determines how the AI should behave and respond to your inputs. You can add, edit, or delete assistants, and customize their instructions and settings.

## Accessing the Assistants Page

1. Open Jan and look at the left sidebar.
2. Click on the **Assistants** tab (see highlighted section in the screenshot above).
3. The main panel will display all your current assistants

## Managing Assistants

- **Add a New Assistant**: Click the `+` button in the Assistants panel to create a new assistant profile.
- **Edit an Assistant**: Click the pencil (‚úèÔ∏è) icon on any assistant card to update its name, description, or instructions.
- **Delete an Assistant**: Click the trash (üóëÔ∏è) icon to remove an assistant you no longer need.

## Customizing Assistant Instructions

Each assistant can have its own set of instructions to guide its behavior. For example:

```
Act as a software development mentor focused on Python and JavaScript.
Provide detailed explanations with code examples when relevant.
Use markdown formatting for code blocks.
```

Or:

```
Respond in a casual, friendly tone. Keep explanations brief and use simple language.
Provide examples when explaining complex topics.
```

## Best Practices
- Be clear and specific about the desired behavior for each assistant.
- Include preferences for formatting, tone, or style.
- Use different assistants for different tasks (e.g., translation, travel planning, financial advice).

*Note: The ability to create, edit, and delete assistants is available in the Assistants tab. Each assistant can be tailored for a specific use case, making Jan a flexible and powerful tool for your needs.*
