# Jan

![Jan's Cover Image](./_assets/jan-app.png)

Jan is an AI chat application that runs 100% offline on your desktop and (*soon*) on mobile. Our goal is to
make it easy for anyone, with or without coding skills, to download and use AI models with full control and
[privacy](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/privacy-paradox-with-ai-2023-10-31/).

Jan is powered by [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), a local AI engine that provides an OpenAI-compatible
API that can run in the background by default at `https://localhost:1337` (or your custom port). This enables you to power all sorts of
applications with AI capabilities from your laptop/PC. For example, you can connect local tools like [Continue](https://jan.ai/integrations/coding/vscode)
and [Cline](https://cline.bot/) to Jan and power them using your favorite models.

Jan doesn't limit you to locally hosted models, meaning, you can create an API key from your favorite model provider,
add it to Jan via the configuration's page and start talking to your favorite models.

### Features

- Download popular open-source LLMs (Llama3, Gemma3, Qwen3, and more) from the HuggingFace [Model Hub](./manage-models.mdx)
or import any GGUF files (the model format used by llama.cpp) available locally
- Connect to [cloud services](/remote-models/openai) (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq, etc.)
- [Chat](./threads.mdx) with AI models & [customize their parameters](./model-parameters.mdx) via our
intuitive interface
- Use our [local API server](https://jan.ai/api-reference) with an OpenAI-equivalent API to power other apps.

### Philosophy

Jan is built to be [user-owned](about#-user-owned), this means that Jan is:
