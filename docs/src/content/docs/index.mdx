Jan is a personal AI assistant that runs entirely on your desktop. No cloud required, no data sent anywhere, no subscriptions. Just you and your AI, having conversations that stay between you two.

Jan provides an OpenAI-compatible API that runs locally at `https://localhost:1337` (or a custom port). This enables you to power other applications running locally with AI capabilities, using your own downloaded models.

## Philosophy

Jan belongs to you. Really:
- Open source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan/blob/dev/LICENSE) (use it, modify it, ship it)
- [Local-first data storage](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first) (your files, your computer, your rules)
- Works offline (the internet is optional, not required)
- Your choice of AI models (local, cloud, or both)
- No data collection (we literally can't see your conversations)
