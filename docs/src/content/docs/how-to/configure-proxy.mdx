Configure Jan to work through corporate proxies or secure network environments.

## Set up HTTPS proxy

HTTPS proxy encrypts data and helps bypass regional restrictions, though it may affect download speeds.

<Steps>

1. **Access proxy settings**

   Go to **Settings** → **Advanced Settings** → **HTTPS Proxy**

2. **Enable proxy**

   Toggle the proxy setting to **On**

3. **Enter proxy details**

   Use this format:

   <Code code="http://<user>:<password>@<domain or IP>:<port>" lang="text" />

   Where:
   - `<user>`: Your proxy username (if required)
   - `<password>`: Your proxy password (if required)  
   - `<domain or IP>`: Proxy server domain or IP address
   - `<port>`: Proxy server port number

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
HTTPS proxy affects model downloads but not remote model usage.

## Configure SSL certificates

For corporate networks or development environments with custom certificates.

<Steps>

1. **Find SSL settings**

   In **Settings** → **Advanced Settings**, look for **Ignore SSL Certificates**

   ![SSL certificate settings](/images/docs/settings-14.png)

2. **Enable if needed**

   Turn this on when:
   - Working with corporate proxies using internal certificates
   - Testing in development environments  
   - Connecting through specialized network security setups

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
Only enable "Ignore SSL Certificates" if you trust your network environment.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting proxy issues

- **Slow downloads**: Proxy encryption/decryption affects speed
- **Connection failures**: Verify proxy credentials and server details
- **Certificate errors**: Enable "Ignore SSL Certificates" for internal networks
