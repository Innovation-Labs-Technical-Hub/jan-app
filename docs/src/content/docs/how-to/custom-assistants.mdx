Assistants are configuration profiles that determine how your AI should behave and respond. Each assistant consists of instructions that guide behavior, model settings for responses, and tool configurations.

## What Are Assistants?

An assistant is essentially a set of rules and preferences that shape how the AI interacts with you:

- **Instructions**: Guide the AI's behavior and response style
- **Model settings**: Control response generation parameters
- **Tool configurations**: Enable features like knowledge retrieval

Jan currently uses a single default assistant named **Jan** across all threads, with plans for multiple custom assistants in future updates.

## Set Assistant Instructions

Customize how Jan understands and responds to your queries by modifying assistant instructions:

1. **Open any thread** and click the **Assistant** tab in the right sidebar
2. **Enter custom instructions** in the Instructions input field
3. **Click out of the field** to apply instructions to the current thread

### Best Practices for Instructions

- **Be specific**: Clear, detailed instructions work better than vague ones
- **Include format preferences**: Specify tone, style, or markdown formatting requirements
- **Set context**: Define the assistant's role or expertise area
- **Provide examples**: Show the type of responses you want

### Example Instructions

**Development Mentor:**
```
Act as a software development mentor focused on Python and JavaScript. 
Provide detailed explanations with code examples when relevant.
Use markdown formatting for code blocks.
Always explain the "why" behind solutions, not just the "how".
```

**Casual Conversationalist:**
```
Respond in a casual, friendly tone. Keep explanations brief and use simple language.
Provide examples when explaining complex topics.
Use humor occasionally but stay helpful and professional.
```

**Technical Writer:**
```
Write clear, concise technical documentation. Use proper headings, bullet points, 
and code examples. Always include troubleshooting tips when relevant.
Structure responses with: Overview, Steps, Expected Results, Troubleshooting.
```

**Creative Assistant:**
```
You are a creative writing partner. Help brainstorm ideas, improve prose, and 
suggest plot developments. Be encouraging and constructive with feedback.
Ask clarifying questions to better understand creative goals.
```

## Apply Instructions to New Threads

Save assistant instructions to automatically apply them to all new conversations:

1. **In any thread**, click the **Assistant** tab in the right sidebar
2. **Toggle the "Save instructions for new threads" slider**
3. **When enabled**, all new threads will use these instructions as default

<Aside type="note">
This setting only affects new threads. Existing threads keep their current instructions unless manually changed.

## Advanced Instruction Techniques

### Role-Based Instructions
Define a specific role for your assistant:
```
You are an expert data scientist with 10 years of experience in machine learning.
Help analyze data problems and suggest appropriate ML approaches.
Always consider data quality and ethical implications in your recommendations.
```

### Context-Aware Instructions
Include information about your use case:
```
I'm a small business owner learning digital marketing. Explain concepts in simple terms
and always relate examples to small business scenarios. Avoid jargon unless you explain it.
Prioritize cost-effective solutions.
```

### Output Format Instructions
Specify exactly how you want responses structured:
```
Structure all responses as:
1. Quick Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Detailed Explanation
3. Example or Code (if applicable)
4. Next Steps or Related Topics

Use bullet points for lists and bold text for key concepts.
```

## Troubleshooting Assistant Behavior

### Instructions Aren't Working
- **Check specificity**: Vague instructions lead to inconsistent behavior
- **Verify saving**: Ensure you clicked out of the field or toggled the save setting
- **Test in new thread**: Create a fresh thread to see if instructions apply
- **Model limitations**: Some models follow instructions better than others

### Inconsistent Responses
- **Add more detail**: Include examples of desired vs. undesired responses
- **Set boundaries**: Explicitly state what the assistant should NOT do
- **Use system prompts**: Frame instructions as system-level behavior rules

### Assistant "Forgets" Instructions
- **Long conversations**: Models may lose track of instructions in very long threads
- **Start new thread**: Begin fresh conversation to reset instruction context
- **Repeat key points**: Include important preferences in your messages

## Understanding Context Limits

Different models have different context windows (memory limits):

- **Smaller models (3B-7B)**: May lose instructions in longer conversations
- **Larger models (13B+)**: Better at maintaining instruction consistency
- **Context refresh**: Instructions are reapplied when starting new threads

## Integration with Model Parameters

Assistant instructions work together with [model parameters](/reference/model-parameters):

- **Temperature**: Lower values make instructions more consistently followed
- **Top P**: Affects how creatively the model interprets instructions
- **System prompt**: Instructions become part of the model's system prompt

<Aside type="tip">
For best results, combine clear instructions with appropriate model parameters. Lower temperature (0.1-0.3) works well for factual assistants, while higher temperature (0.7-1.0) suits creative assistants.

## What's Next?

Once you've set up your assistant:
- Explore [model parameters](/reference/model-parameters) for fine-tuning
- Learn about [thread management](/how-to/manage-threads) 
- Set up [knowledge retrieval tools](/how-to/knowledge-retrieval) for enhanced capabilities
- Try different models to see how they interpret your instructions
