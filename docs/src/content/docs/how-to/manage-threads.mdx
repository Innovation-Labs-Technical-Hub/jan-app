Jan organizes your AI conversations into threads, making it easy to track and revisit your interactions with different models and contexts.

## Understanding Threads

Threads are individual conversation contexts that:
- Maintain conversation history and context
- Keep specific assistant instructions and model settings  
- Allow switching between different topics or model configurations
- Store locally on your device for privacy

Each thread is completely independent, so you can have different conversations running simultaneously.

## Creating New Threads

Start a fresh conversation for a new topic or different model configuration:

1. **Click the New Thread** icon (pencil/square icon) in Jan's top navigation
2. **Select your preferred model** in the Model Selector in the input field
3. **Start chatting** with your first message

### When to Create New Threads

- **Different topics**: Separate work discussions from creative projects
- **Different models**: Test how various models handle the same question  
- **Different contexts**: Switch between coding help and general conversation
- **Fresh start**: Begin without previous conversation influencing responses

## View Thread History

Access and navigate your conversation history:

1. **Open Jan** - the default screen shows **Threads**
2. **In the left sidebar**, you can:
   - View your complete thread list
   - Scroll through conversation history
   - Click any thread to open the full conversation

Thread titles are automatically generated from your first message, but you can customize them for better organization.

## Edit Thread Titles

Rename threads for better organization and easier identification:

1. **Navigate to the thread** you want to rename in the left sidebar
2. **Hover over the thread** and click the **three dots** (⋯) icon
3. **Select "Edit Title"** (pencil icon)
4. **Enter a new title** and save

### Good Thread Naming Practices

- **Be descriptive**: "Python debugging help" vs "Thread 1"
- **Include context**: "Marketing copy for Q1 campaign"
- **Date important conversations**: "Code review - Dec 2024"
- **Use consistent naming**: Develop a personal convention

## Clean Threads

Remove all messages while preserving thread settings and configuration:

1. **Navigate to the target thread** in the left sidebar
2. **Hover and click the three dots** (⋯) icon
3. **Select "Clean Thread"** (brush icon)

<Aside type="note">
This deletes all messages but preserves thread settings, assistant instructions, and model configuration. Useful for starting fresh with the same setup.
</Aside>

### When to Clean Threads

- **Long conversations**: Reset context when threads become unwieldy
- **Testing configurations**: Clear messages while keeping settings
- **Privacy**: Remove sensitive conversation content
- **Performance**: Reduce memory usage for very long threads

## Delete Threads

Completely remove threads you no longer need:

<Aside type="caution">
Thread deletion is permanent. There's no undo option, so ensure you want to remove the thread completely.
</Aside>

### Delete Individual Threads

1. **Navigate to the thread** you want to delete in the left sidebar
2. **Hover and click the three dots** (⋯) icon  
3. **Select "Delete Thread"** (trash icon)
4. **Confirm deletion** when prompted

### Delete All Threads at Once

For complete conversation history removal:

1. **Close Jan** completely
2. **Open the [Jan Data Folder](/explanation/data-storage)**
3. **Delete the `threads` folder**
4. **Restart Jan**

This removes all conversation history while preserving other settings and downloaded models.

## Thread Storage and Privacy

### Local Storage
- All threads stored locally on your device
- No cloud synchronization or external backup
- Complete privacy and control over conversation data

### Data Location
Thread files are stored in your Jan data folder:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\jan\threads\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/jan/threads/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/jan/threads/`

### Backup Considerations
Since threads only exist locally:
- **Manual backup**: Copy the threads folder periodically
- **Export important conversations**: Copy text manually for critical discussions
- **No automatic recovery**: Deleted threads cannot be restored

## Thread Performance

### Memory Usage
Long threads consume more memory:
- **Model context limits**: Very long conversations may exceed model memory
- **Performance impact**: Extremely long threads can slow responses
- **Recommended action**: Start new threads for different topics

### Context Windows
Different models handle conversation length differently:
- **Smaller models (3B-7B)**: May lose early conversation context
- **Larger models (13B+)**: Better at maintaining long conversation context
- **Token limits**: Each model has maximum conversation length limits

## Troubleshooting Threads

### Thread Won't Load
- **Restart Jan**: Simple restart often resolves loading issues
- **Check data folder**: Ensure threads folder exists and isn't corrupted
- **File permissions**: Verify Jan can read/write to data directory

### Missing Threads
- **Check data folder location**: Threads might be in unexpected location
- **Look for backup**: Check if Jan data folder was moved or backed up
- **Recent updates**: Major updates sometimes change data locations

### Slow Thread Performance
- **Clean long threads**: Remove old messages to improve performance
- **Reduce model context**: Lower context window in model settings
- **Check available memory**: Ensure sufficient RAM for model and conversation

## Integration with Models and Settings

### Model Selection Per Thread
Each thread can use different models:
- Switch models mid-conversation
- Compare responses from different models
- Use specialized models for specific tasks

### Assistant Instructions Per Thread
Customize behavior per conversation:
- Set different instructions for work vs. personal threads
- Adjust tone and style per thread context
- Save instructions for new threads globally

## What's Next?

After mastering thread management:
- Learn about [custom assistant instructions](/how-to/custom-assistants)
- Explore [model parameters](/reference/model-parameters) for better responses
- Understand [local data storage](/explanation/data-storage) for backup strategies
- Set up [GPU acceleration](/how-to/gpu-configuration) for faster responses
