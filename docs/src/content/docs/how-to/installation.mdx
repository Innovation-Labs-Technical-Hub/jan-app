<Steps>

1. **Download Jan**

   Use one of the download links above to get Jan for your operating system.

2. **Install the application**

   **Windows:**
   - Run the downloaded `.exe` file
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - Launch Jan from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut

   **macOS:**
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
   - Drag Jan to your Applications folder
   - Launch Jan from Applications (you may need to allow it in Security & Privacy settings)

   **Linux:**
   - For `.deb`: Run `sudo dpkg -i jan-linux.deb`
   - For `.AppImage`: Make it executable with `chmod +x Jan.AppImage` and run it

3. **First launch**

   Jan opens to an empty interface‚Äîno models pre-installed. We could have bundled a 40GB model, but your SSD probably appreciates the restraint.

4. **Download your first model**

   Let's download a small, efficient model that's perfect for getting started:

   1. Click on the **Hub** tab in the left sidebar
   2. Look for a model like "Llama 3.2 3B" or "Phi-3 Mini" (these are good starter models)
   3. Click on the model to see its details
   4. Click the **Download** button

   The download will start automatically. Depending on your internet connection, this might take a few minutes.

5. **Wait for download completion**

   You'll see a progress bar showing the download status. Once complete, the model will appear in your local models list.

   :::tip[Model size matters]
   Start with smaller models (3-7B parameters) as they're faster to download and use less computer memory. You can always download larger, more capable models later.
   :::

6. **Start your first conversation**

   1. Click on **Threads** in the left sidebar (or the chat icon)
   2. Click **Create new thread** or use the existing default thread
   3. In the model selector at the bottom, choose the model you just downloaded
   4. Type a simple message like "Hello! Can you introduce yourself?"
   5. Press Enter or click the send button

7. **Explore the interface**

   Once the AI responds, take a moment to explore:
   
   - **Left sidebar**: Navigate between Threads, Hub, and Settings
   - **Right sidebar**: Configure the current model's behavior and parameters
   - **Chat area**: Your conversation history
   - **Bottom input**: Where you type your messages

</Steps>

## Congratulations! üéâ

You've successfully installed Jan and had your first conversation with a local AI model. Your AI conversations are completely private and running entirely on your computer.

## What's next?

Now that you have Jan running, you might want to:

- **Try different models**: Visit the Hub to download models optimized for different tasks
- **Customize responses**: Learn about [assistant instructions](/how-to/custom-assistants) to tailor how the AI responds
- **Explore settings**: Configure [GPU acceleration](/tutorials/gpu-setup) for faster responses
- **Connect cloud models**: Add [API keys for cloud services](/tutorials/cloud-models) like OpenAI or Anthropic

## Why local AI matters

Jan runs on your computer, not someone else's:

- ‚úÖ **Privacy**: Your conversations stay with you (revolutionary concept)
- ‚úÖ **No subscriptions**: Local models are free (cloud models cost what they cost)
- ‚úÖ **Works offline**: Internet optional after initial download
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Uses your hardware**: Performance varies with your setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Storage requirements**: Models need space (2-40GB+ each)
