import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This tutorial assumes you've already [installed Jan](/tutorials/installation) and downloaded at least one model. You'll learn how to have effective conversations, customize AI behavior, and understand what makes conversations with local AI different.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:
- Start new conversations and organize them into threads
- Customize how the AI responds using assistant instructions
- Adjust model parameters for different conversation styles
- Switch between models for different types of tasks

## Before you start

- **Prerequisites**: Jan installed with at least one model downloaded
- **Time required**: 15-20 minutes
- **Skill level**: Beginner

<Steps>

1. **Create a new conversation thread**

   Threads in Jan are separate conversation contexts, like different chat windows:

   1. Click **Threads** in the left sidebar
   2. Click **New Thread** (+ button) or "Create new thread"
   3. Give your thread a descriptive name like "Creative Writing" or "Technical Questions"

   Each thread maintains its own conversation history and can use different models or settings.

2. **Choose your model**

   Different models excel at different tasks:

   1. In your thread, look for the model selector (usually at the bottom of the chat)
   2. Click it to see your available models
   3. For this tutorial, choose any model you've downloaded

   :::tip[Model selection tips]
   - **Smaller models (3-7B)**: Faster responses, good for simple conversations
   - **Larger models (13B+)**: More capable but slower, better for complex tasks
   - **Specialized models**: Some are optimized for coding, creative writing, or specific languages
   :::

3. **Customize the AI's personality and behavior**

   This is where Jan shines compared to other AI tools. You can completely customize how the AI responds:

   1. Look for the **Assistant** tab in the right sidebar
   2. In the **Instructions** field, write how you want the AI to behave

   Try this example instruction:
   ```
   You are a helpful writing coach. Provide constructive feedback on writing, 
   suggest improvements, and encourage creativity. Keep responses encouraging 
   but honest about areas for improvement.
   ```

4. **Start with a simple conversation**

   Let's test your customized assistant:

   1. Type a message in the chat input
   2. Try: "I'm working on a short story about time travel. Can you help me brainstorm some unique plot ideas?"
   3. Press Enter and wait for the response

   Notice how the AI's response reflects the instructions you provided.

5. **Experiment with different conversation styles**

   Try changing the instructions to see how it affects responses:

   **For technical help:**
   ```
   You are a knowledgeable tech support specialist. Provide clear, 
   step-by-step solutions. Always ask clarifying questions if needed.
   ```

   **For casual conversation:**
   ```
   You are a friendly, casual conversation partner. Use humor when 
   appropriate and show genuine interest in topics.
   ```

   **For learning:**
   ```
   You are a patient tutor. Explain concepts clearly, provide examples, 
   and check understanding before moving to advanced topics.
   ```

6. **Adjust model parameters**

   Fine-tune how the model generates responses:

   1. Click the **Model** tab in the right sidebar
   2. Experiment with these key settings:

   - **Temperature (0.1-1.5)**: Lower = more focused/consistent, Higher = more creative/random
   - **Max Tokens**: Limits response length
   - **Top P**: Controls response diversity

   ![Model Parameters](/docs/_assets/model-parameters.png)

   :::note[Parameter effects]
   - **Temperature 0.3**: Great for factual Q&A, technical support
   - **Temperature 0.7**: Balanced for general conversation
   - **Temperature 1.0+**: Best for creative writing, brainstorming
   :::

7. **Try different types of conversations**

   Test your setup with various conversation types:

   **Creative tasks:**
   - "Write a haiku about artificial intelligence"
   - "Help me plan a fantasy world for my novel"

   **Problem-solving:**
   - "I need to organize my daily schedule better"
   - "What are some strategies for learning a new language?"

   **Technical questions:**
   - "Explain machine learning in simple terms"
   - "How do I choose the right programming language for my project?"

8. **Manage multiple conversations**

   Create different threads for different purposes:

   1. Create a new thread called "Work Projects"
   2. Set up assistant instructions for professional communication
   3. Switch between threads to maintain different conversation contexts

   This way, your creative writing assistant won't interfere with your work-related conversations.

</Steps>

## Understanding conversation flow

### Context and memory
- Each thread maintains conversation history
- The AI remembers previous messages in the same thread
- Longer conversations may hit token limits (the AI's memory capacity)

### Response quality
- Local models may respond differently than cloud AI services
- Response time depends on your computer's performance
- Quality varies by model size and specialization

## Troubleshooting conversations

**If responses seem inconsistent:**
- Check your assistant instructions for clarity
- Try adjusting temperature settings
- Consider if the model is appropriate for your task

**If responses are too slow:**
- Try a smaller model
- Enable [GPU acceleration](/tutorials/gpu-setup)
- Reduce max token settings

**If responses are cut off:**
- Increase the max tokens parameter
- Break complex requests into smaller parts

## Advanced conversation techniques

### Conversation starters that work well
- Be specific about what you want
- Provide context for complex topics
- Ask for step-by-step explanations when needed

### Effective prompting
```
Good: "Help me write a professional email declining a meeting invitation, 
keeping a friendly tone and suggesting alternative times."

Less effective: "Write an email."
```

## What's next?

Now that you're comfortable with basic conversations:

- Learn to [set up GPU acceleration](/tutorials/gpu-setup) for faster responses
- Explore [different models](/how-to/download-models) for specialized tasks
- Try [connecting cloud models](/tutorials/cloud-models) for comparison
- Set up the [API server](/how-to/api-server) to use Jan with other applications

## Key takeaways

1. **Threads organize conversations**: Use different threads for different topics or purposes
2. **Instructions shape behavior**: Well-written assistant instructions dramatically improve response quality
3. **Parameters control style**: Temperature and other settings fine-tune how the model responds
4. **Local AI is different**: Responses may vary from cloud services, but you have complete control and privacy
