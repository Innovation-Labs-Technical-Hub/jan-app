Learn how to set up and use Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Jan to connect your AI assistant to external data sources, APIs, and tools.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that allows AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. With MCP, Jan can:

- Access live data from databases and APIs
- Interact with external tools and services
- Maintain secure, controlled connections to your data
- Extend capabilities beyond local knowledge

<Aside type="note">
MCP enables Jan to become more than just a conversational AI - it becomes a powerful interface to your entire digital ecosystem.
