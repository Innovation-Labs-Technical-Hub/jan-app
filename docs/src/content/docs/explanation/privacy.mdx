title: Privacy & Security
description: How Jan protects your privacy through local processing and what data stays on your device.
---

Jan's privacy model is simple: your conversations don't leave your computer. Here's what that actually means.

## Local processing

When you chat with Jan:
- AI processing happens on your device
- No data sent to external servers (unless you choose cloud models)
- Conversation history stored locally
- No analytics, telemetry, or "usage insights" collected

This isn't a marketing claim—it's an architectural requirement. Jan literally can't phone home with your data because it doesn't have the infrastructure to receive it.

## Data storage

Everything stays in your [Jan data folder](/explanation/data-storage):

- **Conversations**: Thread history, assistant configurations
- **Models**: Downloaded AI models and their settings  
- **User preferences**: Interface settings, extensions
- **Cache**: Temporary files for performance

Location depends on your OS:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\jan`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/jan`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/jan`

## When data might leave your device

Jan gives you the choice to use cloud AI services:

- **OpenAI models**: Your messages go to OpenAI's servers
- **Anthropic models**: Conversations processed by Anthropic
- **Other cloud providers**: Each has their own data policies

These connections are opt-in. You add API keys, you decide what to send. Local models never trigger external requests.

## Network connections

Jan makes network requests for:
- **Model downloads**: From HuggingFace, Jan Hub, or other model repositories
- **Updates**: Application updates (can be disabled)
- **Cloud models**: Only when you configure and use them

That's it. No background analytics, no crash reporting, no "improving our services."

## Security considerations

### Local models
- Run in isolated processes
- No network access unless explicitly configured
- Model files validated before execution
- Sandboxed from system resources

### Cloud models
- API keys stored locally with system encryption
- Connections use HTTPS/TLS
- No logging of API requests by Jan
- You control which conversations use cloud services

### Extension system
- Extensions run in controlled environments
- Limited system access
- Community extensions undergo basic security review
- You can review extension source code

## Comparing privacy models

| Aspect | Jan (Local) | Cloud AI Services |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Data processing | Your device | Company servers |
| Conversation storage | Local only | Varies by provider |
| Model updates | Manual/optional | Automatic |
| Data retention | Until you delete | Provider dependent |
| Access logs | None | Varies |
| Third-party sharing | None | See terms of service |

## Trust, but verify

Jan is [open source](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan) under Apache 2.0. You can:
- Review the source code
- Build from source
- Audit network traffic
- Fork and modify

The privacy claims aren't just promises—they're verifiable.

## Privacy best practices

To maximize privacy with Jan:

1. **Use local models**: Download models instead of using cloud APIs
2. **Review extensions**: Check what community extensions do before installing
3. **Monitor network**: Use tools like Little Snitch (macOS) or Wireshark to verify traffic
4. **Backup wisely**: Encrypt backups of your Jan data folder
5. **Secure your device**: Jan is only as secure as your computer

## Common questions

**Q: Does Jan phone home for analytics?**  
A: No. Zero telemetry by design.

**Q: Are my conversations used to train models?**  
A: Local conversations aren't sent anywhere. Cloud conversations follow each provider's policies.

**Q: Can Jan access other files on my computer?**  
A: Only files you explicitly import or share. No background file scanning.

**Q: What about automatic updates?**  
A: Jan checks for updates but doesn't auto-install. You choose when to update.

**Q: How do I know Jan isn't secretly collecting data?**  
A: Check the source code, monitor network traffic, or trust that a business model based on privacy probably shouldn't violate privacy.

The real privacy protection isn't in our policies—it's in the architecture. Local processing means your data stays local, period.
